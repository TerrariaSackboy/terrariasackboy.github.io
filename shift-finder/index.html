        <h1>About Shift Finder</h1>
        <p>Shift Finder is a web app that is designed to ease the experience of
          laying out people's shifts. Currently, it is planned to save user data in
          the browser's local storage.
          <a href="app.html">Give it a try!</a>
        </p>
    
        <h2>Adding People</h2>
        <p>To add a person to the schedule, just press the plus button.
        </p>

        <h2>Saving Schedule Templates</h2>
        <p>If you have a nice set of times on a person, you can set it as the
          default by clicking the "..." button and selecting "Save Template".
          When you make a new schedule, it will automagically fill all the rows
          from your templates.
        </p>

        <h2>Editing Time Templates</h2>
        <p>When you select one of the main boxes, a dropdown will show up with
          some selectable default times. If you want to change what appears,
          choose the "Time Templates" button on the toolbar.
        </p>

        <h2>Saving and Loading Schedules</h2>
        <p>The application autosaves some things, such as the days you hid, the
          list of names, and their order, whenever you leave. You can load these
          with the Load Saved Schedule button from the Load button in the toolbar.
        </p>
        <p>You can also export or import the entire schedule through the save
          and load menus. This is useful if you need to clear your cache for some
          reason. I forgot to make a button to export templates and other settings
          though. Coming soon I think.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Printing a Schedule</h2>
        <p>When you have all the values inputted into the schedule, you can use
          your browser's print option to get it onto paper, a .pdf file, or
          whatever else.
